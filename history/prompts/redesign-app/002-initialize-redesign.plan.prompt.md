## Prompt

@[TerminalName: cmd, ProcessId: 2780]

## Response snapshot

I've reviewed the project state and initialized the task tracker and implementation plan for the UI/UX redesign. The goal is to move the core logic to a dashboard and create a modern landing page.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established planning artifacts for the redesign project.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: task.md, implementation_plan.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Review plan with user and begin implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user provided a terminal ID which was empty, likely signaling readiness to start or continue work in that environment.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): start implementing the dashboard route.
