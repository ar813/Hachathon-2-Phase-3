   * Reduce confusion and improve usability at every step.

3. **No Backend or Logic Changes**

   * Do **NOT** change backend logic, APIs, database, or functionality.
   * Only UI and UX improvements are allowed.

4. **Add 20+ New UI/UX Features (Frontend Only)**

5. **Navbar Improvement**

   * Redesign the navbar completely.
   * Make it modern, responsive, and professional.
   * Add dropdowns, active states, and smooth animations.

6. **Tailwind CSS Only**

   * Use **ONLY Tailwind CSS**.
   * No external CSS frameworks or custom CSS files.

7. **Public Home Page**

   * Create a **Home page** visible to **unauthorized (not logged-in) users**.
   * Home page should explain the product clearly.
   * Add call-to-action buttons (Login / Sign Up).

8. **Professional Look & Feel**
